# PracticeCV

##Project analysis:

###User Profile:

The final user will likely be HR employees looking for some new employees for the enterprise they are working for, they will care about formation, and work experience, personal projects are also a thing they will take into consideration.

###Information architecture:

This is a single paged website, using a bit of JavaScript in some sections latterly described. The page header consists of my photo, my name, my actual state in a phrase and the contact information (my mail and phone which would be switched to my personal ones in a real CV) which I consider to be relevant. The article is composed of 4 sections, 2 of them on the left side and 2 more on the right side. These sections are respectively: About Me, where I shortly describe myself; My Personal Projects, consisting on the public projects I made (just the CV for now) and links to the different section of the projects; Work Experience where I summarize where and when I worked (just as my contacts this would be changed to the actual ones in a real CV); and Formation where I summarize where I was formed and the year I finished each studies. All of the previous sections are made in a way so when a user clicks on a section title, It hides/shows the section contents by using a little bit of JavaScript, this gives some degree of interactivity, which would likely be taken into account by the users.

###Visual Design:

As the page needs to be formal, I opted to use different tonalities of gray, a lighter one for the header (105,105,105) and a darker one for the rest of the page (49,49,49), this colors make the page minimalistic but elegant, so I think they fit pretty well: To increase the contrast between background and the text I made the headings to be white (255,255,255) and paragraphs very light gray (204,204,204).

The page also uses a shade of blue (30,144,255) as a secondary color, mainly used as a background in each section of the article, where I changed the text color to be black (0,0,0) so it has more contrast. This blue is also used as text color for the class “Year” (every date from wok experience and formation), text which is also in italics. The hyperlinks also use this color when the user hovers its mouse over it, giving the sensation to the user that they can interact with it. Another visual design decision I made related to the colors was to invert the text and background colors of the article titles when hovering the mouse over them, and giving just as the hyperlinks a sensation of interactivity.

The fonts I ended up using (Lucida Sans) are different from the ones I planned to use in the Figma project, this is simply because I preferred how the page ended up looking with this new fonts than those in Figma.
